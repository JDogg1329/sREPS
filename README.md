to	the	general	public.	Their	current	system	is	paper	based	for	recording	sales	and	are	finding it	challenging	to	
record	their	weekly	and	monthly	sales.	They	are	also	having	trouble	restoring	stock	on	time	when	needed	in

would	help	with	the	process	of	recording	weekly	and	monthly	sales	to	make	it	easier	for	them	to	restock	items	
when	needed.	The	application	needs	to	present	graphical	user	interface	(GUI),	printed	reports	generated	need	
to	be	converted	and	outputted	with	comma	separated	values	(CSV)
